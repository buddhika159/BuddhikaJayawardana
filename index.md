>We construct a symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonian systems combining an extended phase space approach of Pihajoki and the symmetric projection method. The resulting method is semiexplicit in the sense that the main time evolution step is explicit whereas the symmetric projection step is implicit. The symmetric projection binds potentially diverging copies of solutions, thereby remedying the main drawback of the extended phase space approach. Moreover, our semiexplicit method is symplectic in the original phase space. This is in contrast to existing extended phase space integrators, which are symplectic only in the extended phase space. We demonstrate that our method exhibits an excellent long-time preservation of invariants, and also that it tends to be as fast as and can be faster than Taoâ€™s explicit modified extended phase space integrator particularly for small enough time steps and with higher-order implementations and for higher-dimensional problems.

[Project 2 Title](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

>We propose a systematic procedure called the Clebsch canonization for obtaining a canonical Hamiltonian system that is related to a given Lie-Poisson equation via a momentum map. We describe both coordinate and geometric versions of the procedure, the latter apparently for the first time. We also find another momentum map so that the pair of momentum maps constitute a dual pair under a certain condition. The dual pair gives a concrete realization of what is commonly referred to as collectivization of Lie-Poisson systems. It also implies that solving the canonized system by symplectic Runge-Kutta methods yields so-called collective Lie-Poisson integrators that preserve the coadjoint orbits and hence the Casimirs exactly. We give a couple of examples, including the Kida vortex and the heavy top on a movable base with controls, which are Lie-Poisson systems on $so(2,1)^*$  and $(se(3) \times R^3)^*$, respectively.
