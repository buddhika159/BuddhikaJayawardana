>We construct a symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonian systems combining an extended phase space approach of Pihajoki and the symmetric projection method. The resulting method is semiexplicit in the sense that the main time evolution step is explicit whereas the symmetric projection step is implicit. The symmetric projection binds potentially diverging copies of solutions, thereby remedying the main drawback of the extended phase space approach. Moreover, our semiexplicit method is symplectic in the original phase space. This is in contrast to existing extended phase space integrators, which are symplectic only in the extended phase space. We demonstrate that our method exhibits an excellent long-time preservation of invariants, and also that it tends to be as fast as and can be faster than Taoâ€™s explicit modified extended phase space integrator particularly for small enough time steps and with higher-order implementations and for higher-dimensional problems.

> <p> Non-canonical Hamiltonian systems show up in many physical systems, such as rigid body dynamics and fluid dynamics, which can be identified on a Lie-Poisson manifold and typically possess a few invariants. We developed a new class of numerical integrators for these Lie-Poisson systems by constructing a canonical Hamiltonian system via a momentum map and solving it using a symplectic Runge-Kutta method. We demonstrated that the proposed method preserves system invariants better than the standard explicit Runge-Kutta method applied to the original Lie-Poisson system, and hence exhibits a more accurate longtime performance. </p>

> <p> Let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a Lie algebra. Then one defines the Lie-Poisson bracket on \(\mathfrak{g}^{*}\) and the canonical Poisson bracket on \(T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}\) as follows:  </p>
  

> <p> For any \(f,g: \mathfrak{g}^{*} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) and \(F,G: T^{*}\mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\),
\[
\begin{equation*} 
\{f,g\}_{LP} (\mu) := \mu_k c_{ij}^k  \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \mu_i} \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial \mu_j} \quad\quad \text{and} \quad\quad 
\{F,G\}_P := \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial q^i} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial p_i} - \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial q^i} \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial p_i}.
\end{equation*}
\] </p>

> <p> With the help of a momentum map \(M:T^*\mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathfrak{g}^{*}\) defined as \(\mu_i := c_{ij}^k q^j p_k\), we showed that we can relate the two brackets by setting \(F(q,p) = f(\mu)\) and \(G(q,p) = g(\mu)\). </p>
